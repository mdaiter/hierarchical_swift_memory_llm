Ben (VectorPulse) is repeatedly pressing Matthew for confirmation of the seat ramp and explicit acknowledgement of the telemetry clause (high follow-up pressure\/urgency). Agentic pilot updates (#74\/#75) raise capacity planning, finance guardrails, and legal\/telemetry alignment, and Ben asked about audit logging related to infra uplift vs shared tenancy.\n\nDecisions \/ Actions taken\n- Matthew: forwarded the deck to finance & legal for signature (in progress; multiple iMessage confirmations).\n- Ops \/ CFO \/ ops-analyst: actively tracking audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks.\n- Agentic pilot updates issued (calls out legal\/telemetry alignment, capacity & finance guardrails).\n\nConcerns \/ Questions\n- Seat ramp specifics (schedule\/quantity) need confirmation from Matthew\/VectorPulse.\n- Explicit acknowledgement\/acceptance of the telemetry clause is required by Ben\/VectorPulse.\n- Clarification needed on audit logging and how infra uplift vs shared tenancy affects audit requirements.\n- Finance\/legal signature on the deck not yet confirmed — potential blocker for finalization.\n- Details (scope, owners, deadlines) for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks remain incomplete.\n\nUnresolved items (owners \/ next steps \/ status)\n1. Confirm seat ramp (Owner: Matthew → reply to Ben). Status: pending; Ben repeatedly awaiting confirmation.\n2. Acknowledge\/accept telemetry clause (Owner: Matthew \/ Legal \/ Finance → confirm to Ben). Status: pending; repeated pings indicate urgency.\n3. Confirm finance & legal signature on deck (Owner: Finance & Legal; Matthew to follow up). Status: pending — deck forwarded but signature not confirmed.\n4. Clarify audit logging requirements re: infra uplift vs shared tenancy (Owner: Engineering\/Infra\/Security). Status: open — raised in Ben’s email.\n5. Define and close items for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, automation runbooks (Owner: Ops-team \/ ops-analyst \/ CFO). Status: in progress — scope, owners, deadlines not fully recorded.\n6. Follow-ups from Agentic pilot update #75 (Owner: Matthew \/ Ops \/ Legal). Status: open — legal\/telemetry alignment and capacity\/finance guardrails to be resolved.\n\nNotes \/ context\n- Multiple repeated WhatsApp\/iMessage\/Slack pings indicate pressure to resolve seat\/telemetry and secure signatures.\n- Recommended immediate coordination: Matthew to (a) confirm seat ramp and telemetry ack to Ben, (b) confirm signature status with finance\/legal; Ops to granularize owners\/deadlines for tracked items; Engineering\/Security to answer audit-logging
