Multiple repeated messages indicate urgency; no resolution recorded in these logs.\n\nDecisions \/ actions taken\n- Matthew forwarded\/pushed the deck to finance and legal for signature (repeatedly communicated).\n- Matthew sent Agentic pilot update emails (noted: #100 and #101) covering capacity planning, finance guardrails and follow-ups.\n\nConcerns \/ questions raised\n- Ben repeatedly requested explicit confirmation on:\n  - Seat ramp (scaling\/rollout) — “confirming seat ramp?”\n  - Telemetry clause — acknowledgement\/acceptance.\n- Finance question #100: clarification needed on “infra uplift vs. shared tenancy.”\n- Clarification needed on audit logging: requirements and ownership.\n- Risk noted that legal\/finance review could change telemetry or seat-ramp terms.\n\nUnresolved items \/ follow-ups (with suggested owners)\n- Confirm seat ramp details and acceptance (owner: Matthew \/ ops \/ legal) — include specifics of ramp schedule and criteria.\n- Acknowledge\/accept or revise telemetry clause (owner: legal \/ Matthew) — confirm whether clause is acceptable or requires edits.\n- Answer finance question #100: infra uplift vs shared tenancy implications (owner: ops\/finance\/engineering) — provide technical and cost\/ops impact.\n- Clarify audit logging requirements and ownership (owner: ops\/engineering \/ finance).\n- Confirm finance\/legal signature status and expected timing; identify final sign-off owner (owner: finance\/legal \/ Matthew).\n- Track whether legal\/finance proposed changes affect seat ramp or telemetry (owner: Matthew\/legal).\n\nPriority\n- High — multiple repeated pings indicate time-sensitive gating items (signature + contract acknowledgements).\n\nSuggested immediate next steps\n- Matthew or legal to post an explicit ack\/status for seat ramp and telemetry clause.\n- Provide a concise response to finance question #100 and audit logging ownership.\n- Update the thread with expected sign-off owner and ETA for
