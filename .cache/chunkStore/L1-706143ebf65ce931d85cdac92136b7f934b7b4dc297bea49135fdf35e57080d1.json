Provide timestamped signature or redlines.\n- Matthew: secure and publish explicit on-record confirmation of seat ramp once legal signs; escalate if Finance\/Legal delay.\n- Ops: monitor capacity planning and finance guardrails from Agentic pilot updates; surface downstream impacts if signature is delayed.\n- Ben: request a written ack and ETA; escalate if no response by agreed
