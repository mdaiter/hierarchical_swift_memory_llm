Clarify audit logging requirements: scope, retention, telemetry integration, compliance expectations, and who will own\/operate logs. (Owner: suggested — ops\/engineering + legal; currently unassigned.)\n2. Decide infra deployment model: infra uplift (dedicated) vs. shared tenancy — include cost, ownership, operational impact, and compliance tradeoffs. (Owner: suggested — finance + ops\/architecture; currently unassigned.)\n3. Finalize legal + telemetry alignment: policy decisions on data handling, retention, access controls that affect telemetry and compliance. (Owner: suggested — legal\/telemetry\/ops; currently unassigned.)\n4. Define capacity planning targets and finance guardrails: metrics, thresholds, monitoring and enforcement. (Owner: suggested — finance\/ops; currently unassigned.)\n5. Assign explicit owners and schedule a decisive sync (30–60 min) among legal, finance, telemetry, ops, and infra to resolve the above. (Suggested next step; not yet done.)\n\nNotable contextual observation\n- Repetition across multiple days indicates persistent lack of resolution and that issues are being repeatedly flagged rather than
