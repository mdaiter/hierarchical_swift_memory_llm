Deck signature (status: pending)\n   - Owner: Atlas finance\/legal \/ Matthew\n   - Action: confirm whether signed; provide ETA.\n\n2. Seat ramp approval & schedule (status: unresolved)\n   - Owner: Matthew \/ Atlas finance\n   - Action: explicit confirmation of seat ramp and schedule.\n\n3. Telemetry clause acceptance or redlines (status: unresolved)\n   - Owner: Atlas legal \/ Matthew\n   - Action: formal acceptance or list of redlines\/conditions.\n\n4. Tenancy model decision: infra uplift vs shared tenancy (status: unresolved)\n   - Owner: Atlas finance \/ ops \/ Matthew\n   - Action: recommend model, show cost\/ops\/compliance implications.\n\n5. Audit logging spec (scope, retention, access, responsibility) (status: unresolved)\n   - Owner: ops \/ engineering \/ legal\n   - Action: provide concise spec addressing auditability\/compliance and who will operate\/store logs.\n\n6. Capacity planning aligned to finance guardrails (status: in-progress but not finalized)\n   - Owner: Matthew \/ ops \/ finance\n   - Action: reconcile capacity plan with finance constraints and document.\n\n7. Ops engagement\/ownership confirmation (status: unclear)\n   - Owner: ops@atlas.vc \/ Matthew\n   - Action: confirm ops will own\/implement any operational items (audit logging, tenancy ops).\n\nRecommended immediate actions (concise)\n- Matthew \/ Atlas legal: reply to Ben (and cc ops@atlas.vc) with (1) seat ramp approval & schedule, (2) telemetry clause acceptance or redlines, (3) ETA for finance\/legal sign-off.\n- Atlas finance \/ ops: decide\/recommend tenancy model (infra uplift vs shared tenancy) with cost and compliance implications.\n- Ops\/engineering\/legal: publish a short audit-logging spec (scope, retention, access controls, ownership).\n- Matthew: consolidate these answers into a single authoritative reply to close the loop and unblock execution.\n\nUnresolved risks\/blockers\n- Progress is blocked without legal sign-off and explicit answers on telemetry, tenancy, audit logging and seat ramp timing. Repeated status updates without these specifics are not resolving the finance
