Decide infra model (infra uplift vs shared tenancy) and capture cost, security, compliance, and operational tradeoffs.\n2. Define audit-logging specification: what to log, retention periods, access controls, ownership, and how it meets audit\/compliance needs.\n3. Align Legal and Telemetry on data policies (collection, retention, access, compliance obligations).\n4. Finalize capacity-planning numbers and explicit finance guardrails (thresholds, escalation, budget impacts, cost allocation).\n5. Assign clear owners and timelines for items 1–4; Ops needs to be involved for implementation details.\n6. Record decisions and communicate them to stop the repetitive back-and-forth.\n\nRecommended next actions (to resolve quickly)\n- Convene short decision sync with Legal, Finance, Telemetry, and Ops (30–60 min).\n- Produce a one-page options vs. tradeoffs doc for infra uplift vs shared tenancy (include cost models and audit\/logging implications).\n- Deliver an audit-logging spec draft and assign an owner for implementation and compliance sign-off.\n- Assign owners and deadlines for capacity planning and finance guardrails; log decisions in a shared place.\n\nStatus signal\n- Thread remains active and unresolved as of message #560; requires escalation to a named owner\/meeting to
