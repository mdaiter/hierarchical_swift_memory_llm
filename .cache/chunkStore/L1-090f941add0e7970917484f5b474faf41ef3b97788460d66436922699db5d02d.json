Exchanges ran hourly and repetitively across messages #561–#592.\n- Focus: legal ↔ telemetry alignment, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n- Pattern: Matthew posted repeated updates; Ben repeatedly requested clarity on finance-impacting items. Ops was CC’d but did not provide substantive responses in these threads.\n\nDecisions (observed)\n- No final approvals recorded. Ongoing agreement to prioritize alignment across legal, telemetry, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n\nConcerns raised\n- Audit logging: unclear requirements (scope, retention, access, ownership).\n- Infrastructure model: need to choose between infra uplift (dedicated infra) vs. shared tenancy — implications for cost, billing, isolation, security, and audit.\n- Ensuring legal and telemetry alignment suffices for compliance and finance needs.\n- Capacity planning numbers contingent on infra and telemetry\/legal decisions.\n\nUnresolved items \/ action items (owners suggested)\n1. Define audit logging spec: what is logged, retention, access controls, storage\/retention costs, who owns logs — owner: ops\/security; stakeholder: legal, telemetry, finance.\n2. Decide infra model: infra uplift vs. shared tenancy with cost\/benefit, security, billing, and audit implications — owner: finance\/architecture; input: ops, security.\n3. Finalize capacity planning numbers and finance guardrails consistent with chosen infra and logging spec — owner: finance with ops input.\n4. Confirm legal ↔ telemetry alignment on instrumentation, data flows, and compliance criteria — owner: legal and telemetry leads.\n5. Ops to respond with technical impacts\/costs (no reply recorded) — owner: ops.\n\nSuggested next steps (implicit, high priority)\n- Convene short decision meeting (finance, ops\/security, legal, Matthew, Ben) to decide tenancy model and logging ownership.\n- Produce: (a) cost\/benefit comparison of infra uplift vs. shared tenancy, and (b) audit-logging specification (who, what, retention, access, compliance mapping).\n- Use outcomes to finalize capacity planning and finance guardrails, then circulate for sign-off.\n\nStatus note\n- High-frequency, unresolved exchange indicates escalation\/urgent clarification needed; no resolution within these
