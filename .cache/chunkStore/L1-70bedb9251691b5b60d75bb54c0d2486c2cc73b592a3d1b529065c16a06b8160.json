Multiple channels (iMessage, WhatsApp, Slack, email). Repeated pings indicate urgency.\n\nDecisions \/ Actions (recorded)\n- Matthew: pushed the deck to Atlas Finance & Legal for signature (multiple iMessages; action in progress).\n- Ops \/ CFO \/ Rev-ops: actively tracking audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks (Slack updates).\n- Agentic pilot update #57 (email) issued; contains capacity planning and finance guardrails (reference for finance\/legal discussions).\n\nConcerns \/ issues raised\n- Seat ramp: Ben repeatedly requested confirmation of ramp terms.\n- Telemetry clause: Ben requested explicit acknowledgement; need alignment between Legal and telemetry requirements.\n- Audit logging \/ infra model: finance raised question #58 — infra uplift vs. shared tenancy (impact on audit logging and costs).\n- Billing carve-outs and automation runbooks: potential gaps, overlapping trackers, and unclear owners.\n- Status ambiguity: repeated, duplicate messages and no recorded signature or explicit acknowledgements — risk of missed responses.\n\nUnresolved items \/ open actions\n1. Explicit acknowledgement\/confirmation of seat ramp from Atlas (Ben ↔ Matthew) — not recorded.\n2. Explicit acknowledgement\/acceptance of the telemetry clause and Legal alignment on telemetry requirements — open.\n3. Finance question #58: decision on infra uplift vs. shared tenancy and implications for audit logging — unresolved.\n4. Final signature status: whether Finance & Legal have signed the deck and any redlines — pending.\n5. Ownership and status updates for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks (owners not specified; work tracked but not detailed).\n6. Any remediation or contract changes required by finance\/legal based on above items — unknown.\n\nSuggested immediate follow-ups (concise)\n- Get explicit confirmation from Matthew\/Legal on seat ramp and telemetry clause ACK.\n- Confirm signature completion and obtain signed deck or list of redlines.\n- Assign owners and status for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks; resolve finance Q#58 (infra uplift vs shared tenancy) and audit logging
