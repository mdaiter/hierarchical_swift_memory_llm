{"latestTimestamp":737421300,"sourceKinds":["email"],"summaryText":"Summary (for semantic memory)\n\nMetadata\n- Date: 2024-05-14 (multiple emails, 15:00–23:15 UTC)\n- Participants: matthew@atlas.vc (sender of legal\/telemetry updates, includes ops@atlas.vc), ben@vectorpulse.ai (finance contact raising questions)\n- Thread labels: \"Agentic pilot update\" #417–#428 (alternating updates between Matthew and Ben)\n\nHigh-level summary\n- Matthew repeatedly sent updates (#417, 419, 421, 423, 425, 427) focused on: legal + telemetry alignment, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n- Ben repeatedly responded (#418, 420, 422, 424, 426, 428) noting finance questions about infrastructure uplift vs. shared tenancy and requesting clarity on audit logging.\n- The exchange is high-frequency and repetitive across the day, indicating these topics remain active\/unresolved.\n\nDecisions\n- No explicit decisions recorded in these messages.\n\nConcerns \/ issues raised\n- Finance needs clarification on \"infra uplift vs. shared tenancy\" (cost\/ownership\/architecture implications).\n- Audit logging requirements\/implementation are unclear and need clarification for compliance\/finance.\n- Legal + telemetry alignment needs follow-up (scope and responsibilities not finalized).\n\nUnresolved items \/ action items\n- Provide clear answer\/position on infra uplift vs shared tenancy (owner: finance & infra teams; requester: Ben).\n- Define audit logging requirements and show how telemetry\/legal constraints affect audit logs (owner: ops\/infra\/legal; requester: Ben\/Matthew).\n- Confirm legal + telemetry alignment details and any impacts on capacity planning \/ finance guardrails (owner: Matthew coordinating with legal and telemetry teams).\n- Because messages repeated without resolution, treat these as high-priority open items until explicit responses or decisions are recorded.\n\nTags \/ memory cues\n- agentic-pilot; legal-telemetry-alignment; capacity-planning; finance-guardrails; infra-uplift-vs-shared-tenancy; audit-logging; open-action-items.\n\nIf you want, I can convert these unresolved items into specific tasks with proposed owners, deadlines, and a draft message to send to
