Status: in progress.\n- Team is tracking audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and creating automation runbooks (CFO \/ ops-analyst \/ ops-team). Status: being tracked.\n- Matthew issued Agentic pilot update #47 covering capacity planning and finance guardrails.\n\nConcerns \/ asks\n- Seat ramp: Ben requests explicit confirmation of the ramp\/schedule (capacity\/resource\/scaling risk).\n- Telemetry clause: Ben requests explicit acknowledgement from Atlas\/Legal (privacy\/compliance\/contract term risk).\n- Finance question #48: clarity needed on \"infra uplift vs. shared tenancy\" and audit logging approach.\n- Repeated identical pings from both sides indicate urgency and a need for direct acknowledgement\/closure.\n\nUnresolved items (owners & status)\n1. Deck signature — Owner: Finance & Legal. Status: pending (deck routed; no signed confirmation).\n2. Seat ramp confirmation — Owner: Matthew \/ ops \/ contract lead. Status: pending (Ben awaiting reply).\n3. Telemetry clause acknowledgement — Owner: Legal \/ Matthew. Status: pending (Ben awaiting explicit ack).\n4. Finance Q#48 (infra uplift vs shared tenancy; audit logging) — Owner: Finance \/ Legal \/ Ops. Status: pending.\n5. Audit coverage, billing carve-outs, automation runbooks — Owner: CFO \/ ops-analyst \/ ops-team. Status: tracked but lacking explicit owners, timelines, or completion detail.\n6. Reduce duplicate\/noise — implicit process improvement needed to avoid repeated identical pings.\n\nRecommended next steps (for immediate closure)\n- Finance & Legal: confirm signature status, surface any redlines, and notify Matthew\/Ben with timestamp.\n- Legal: explicitly state telemetry clause position\/acknowledgement to Ben.\n- Matthew \/ contract owner: confirm seat ramp schedule to Ben (or surface objections\/constraints).\n- Finance\/Legal\/Ops: answer Q#48 on infra uplift vs shared tenancy and audit logging approach.\n- Ops\/CFO: publish owners, status, and timelines for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks.\n- Communicate closures back to Ben to stop repeated
