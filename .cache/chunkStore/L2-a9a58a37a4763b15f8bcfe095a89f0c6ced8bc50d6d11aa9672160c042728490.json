Only ongoing agreement to prioritize alignment across legal, telemetry, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n\nConcerns (explicit)\n- Audit logging: unclear scope, retention, access controls, ownership, storage costs, and verification for audits.\n- Infrastructure model: tradeoffs between dedicated infra (\"infra uplift\") vs. shared tenancy — cost, billing\/chargeback, isolation\/security, operational ownership, and audit implications.\n- Legal ↔ telemetry: outstanding alignment on what telemetry is allowed\/required, data flows, retention, and compliance constraints.\n- Capacity planning & finance guardrails: targets, thresholds, enforcement, and how telemetry\/legal choices affect numbers.\n- Process: ops copied but not engaged; no single-threaded owner and repeated follow-ups indicate stalled decision-making.\n\nUnresolved items \/ Action items (with suggested owners and deliverables)\n1. Define audit-logging spec\n   - Deliverable: spec of events to log, retention, access controls, storage\/cost estimates, owner for logs, compliance mapping.\n   - Suggested owners: ops\/security + legal + telemetry; requester: finance (Ben).\n2. Decide infra deployment model (infra uplift vs. shared tenancy)\n   - Deliverable: one-page decision matrix (cost model, security\/isolation, billing, operational ownership, telemetry\/audit effects).\n   - Suggested owners: finance + architecture\/infra; reviewers: ops, security, legal.\n3. Finalize legal ↔ telemetry alignment\n   - Deliverable: signed list of allowed telemetry types, data handling\/retention rules, sharing constraints.\n   - Suggested owners: legal + telemetry leads; inform ops and finance.\n4. Finalize capacity planning numbers and finance guardrails\n   - Deliverable: concrete capacity targets, thresholds, budgets, chargeback\/enforcement model, telemetry-based monitoring\/alerts.\n   - Suggested owners: finance + ops; engineering\/telemetry to validate feasibility.\n5. Assign explicit owners, timelines, and record decisions\n   - Deliverable: owners + deadlines + decision log to stop repetitive loops.\n   - Suggested owner: Matthew to coordinate \/ convene.\n6. Ops to provide technical impacts and cost responses\n   - Deliverable: implementation impacts and cost estimates for chosen infra\/logging options.\n   - Suggested owner: ops (currently only CC’d; no reply recorded).\n\nRecommended next steps (high priority)\n- Convene a short decision sync (30–60 min) with legal, finance, telemetry, ops, and infra to decide tenancy model and logging ownership.\n- Produce: (a) cost\/benefit comparison of infra uplift vs. shared tenancy, and (b) draft audit-logging spec — use outcomes to finalize capacity planning and finance guardrails.\n- Assign owners and deadlines, capture decisions in a shared log, and communicate to all participants (esp. ops) to break the loop.\n\nStatus \/ Priority\n- High priority and escalatory: frequent, unresolved exchanges across multiple days. Items remain open until owners and timelines are assigned and a cross-functional decision is
