Multiple pings imply urgency.\n\nDecisions \/ Actions in progress\n- Matthew has submitted\/pushed the deck to finance and legal for signature (in progress).\n- Matthew\/Atlas are tracking contract items internally: audit coverage\/audit logging, billing carve-outs, automation runbooks, capacity planning\/finance guardrails.\n\nConcerns \/ Topics being tracked\n- Explicit acknowledgement\/acceptance of the telemetry clause.\n- Confirmation and commitment to the seat ramp (ramp schedule\/commitment).\n- Audit coverage \/ audit-logging details.\n- Finance question #78: infra uplift vs. shared tenancy responsibilities.\n- Billing carve-outs and automation runbooks (scope and details).\n\nUnresolved \/ Open items (with likely owners)\n1. Explicit confirmation\/acknowledgement of the telemetry clause (owner: legal \/ Matthew; requester: Ben).  \n2. Confirmation\/commitment to the seat ramp (owner: finance\/legal \/ Matthew; requester: Ben).  \n3. Formal signature on the deck from finance and legal (owner: finance\/legal).  \n4. Clarify audit logging details and audit coverage scope (owner: ops\/engineering \/ finance).  \n5. Resolve finance Q#78 — infra uplift vs. shared tenancy (owner: finance \/ engineering).  \n6. Finalize billing carve-outs and automation runbooks (owner: ops \/ CFO \/ Matthew).\n\nRecommended next steps \/ Follow-ups\n- Finance\/legal: confirm receipt, sign deck, and explicitly acknowledge the telemetry clause in writing; provide timeline.  \n- Matthew: confirm back to Ben when deck is signed and explicitly acknowledge seat ramp + telemetry clause.  \n- Ben: request an explicit yes\/no on seat ramp + telemetry clause if not provided after signatures.  \n- Ops\/CFO\/Engineering: answer finance Q#78, clarify audit-logging approach, and finalize billing carve-outs and automation runbooks.\n\nParticipants\n- ben@vectorpulse.ai (requester, repeated pings)\n- matthew@atlas.vc (pushing deck; tracking items)\n- ops-analyst@atlas (tracking)\n- cfo@atlas.vc (tracking)\n-
