Clarify audit-logging requirements and owner\n   - Deliverable: spec covering who provides logs, which events, retention, access controls, and compliance needs.\n   - Suggested owners: ops + infra + legal; requester: Ben.\n2. Decide infra uplift vs. shared tenancy\n   - Deliverable: one-page decision matrix comparing cost, security, compliance, telemetry implications, and operational ownership.\n   - Suggested owners: finance + infra\/architecture (Ben + infra lead); reviewer: legal\/ops.\n3. Confirm legal + telemetry alignment specifics\n   - Deliverable: list of allowed telemetry types, data handling rules, sharing constraints, and sign-off from legal.\n   - Suggested owners: legal (Matthew lead) + product\/ops\/telemetry.\n4. Finalize capacity planning & finance guardrails\n   - Deliverable: concrete thresholds, budgets, chargeback or enforcement model, and how telemetry feeds into alerts\/controls.\n   - Suggested owners: finance (Ben) + ops.\n5. Schedule a short cross-functional sync\n   - Purpose: resolve audit-logging and tenancy decision and capture agreed telemetry\/legal constraints.\n   - Suggested participants: legal, ops, finance, infra\/architecture; suggested owner: Matthew to coordinate.\n\nSignals \/ priority\n- Repetition and cadence indicate urgency; treat unresolved items as high priority until a decision owner and deadlines are assigned.\n\nIf you want, I can convert the unresolved items into specific tasks with owners, deadlines, and a draft meeting agenda\/email to break the
