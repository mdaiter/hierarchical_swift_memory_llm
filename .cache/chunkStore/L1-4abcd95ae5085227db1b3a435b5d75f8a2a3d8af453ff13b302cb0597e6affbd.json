Repeated pings: Matthew repeatedly stated he was \"pushing deck to finance and legal for signature\"; Ben repeatedly requested confirmation of the seat-ramp schedule and acknowledgement of the telemetry clause. Finance raised questions (Agentic pilot updates) about infra uplift vs shared tenancy and about audit logging.\n\nDecisions \/ Actions taken\n- Matthew submitted\/pushed the deck to Atlas finance and legal for signature.\n- Matthew issued Agentic pilot updates documenting legal + telemetry follow-up, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n\nConcerns (raised)\n- Need explicit confirmation\/acknowledgement of the seat ramp (seat count ramp schedule).\n- Need explicit acknowledgement of the telemetry clause.\n- Finance question(s) about infra uplift vs shared tenancy (implications\/choice).\n- Need clarity on audit logging requirements\/implementation.\n- Urgency indicated by repeated pings; signature status not yet confirmed.\n\nUnresolved items\n- Confirmation\/acceptance of seat ramp — outstanding.\n- Acknowledgement of telemetry clause — outstanding.\n- Answer to finance Q#84\/#86: infra uplift vs shared tenancy — outstanding.\n- Audit logging requirements\/specs — outstanding.\n- Whether finance\/legal have signed the deck — no confirmation.\n\nOwners \/ Next steps (recommended)\n- Matthew: confirm when finance\/legal sign the deck and explicitly confirm seat ramp and telemetry clause acceptance (or provide redlines\/objections).  \n- Ben + Matthew + Engineering\/Security: define and document recommended approach for infra uplift vs shared tenancy and specify audit logging implementation and retention.  \n- Finance\/Legal: review and sign; confirm any required changes to telemetry wording or seat-ramp schedule.  \n- Immediate recommended actions: (1) Matthew to provide ETA for signature and send explicit seat-ramp\/telemetry ack or objection; (2) schedule a brief technical\/finance call (owners: Ben + Matthew + engineering\/security + finance\/legal) to resolve infra\/shared-tenancy and audit logging items.\n\nTags\n- finance, legal, signature pending, seat ramp, telemetry clause, infra uplift, shared tenancy, audit logging, Agentic
