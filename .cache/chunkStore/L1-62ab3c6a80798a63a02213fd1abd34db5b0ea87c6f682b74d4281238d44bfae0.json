Ongoing iterative status updates continue.\n\nConcerns \/ issues (repeated across threads)\n- Audit logging: unclear requirements and scope (what to log, retention, access, ownership, audit trail).\n- Infra model: unresolved trade-off between \"infra uplift\" (dedicated infra) vs. \"shared tenancy\" (cost\/complexity\/security\/compliance implications).\n- Legal + telemetry alignment: need to ensure telemetry design meets legal\/privacy constraints (data minimization, retention, permitted collection\/sharing).\n- Capacity planning: capacity numbers not finalized and affect finance guardrails.\n- Finance guardrails: cost controls, chargeback model and thresholds unclear.\n- Communication pattern: high-frequency, repetitive updates (~45‑minute cadence); ops is CC'd but not actively responding.\n\nUnresolved items \/ action items (owners \/ status)\n1. Decide infra model — infra uplift vs. shared tenancy. Owner: finance (Ben) + engineering\/Atlas. Status: open.  \n2. Define audit logging spec (scope, retention, access controls, owner). Owner: requester Ben\/finance; implementer: engineering\/ops; legal to confirm compliance. Status: open.  \n3. Confirm legal + telemetry alignment (allowed telemetry, PII handling, retention). Owner: Matthew\/Atlas + legal (cc ops). Status: open.  \n4. Finalize capacity planning numbers and tie to finance guardrails (budget\/thresholds). Owner: Matthew\/ops + finance. Status: open.  \n5. Reduce noise \/ consolidate thread — investigate repetitive messaging and move to single-resolution path (e.g., meeting or single authoritative response). Owner: ops\/Atlas. Status: open.\n\nRecommended next step (consistent with thread suggestions)\n- Convene a short sync with Matthew, Ben, ops, engineering, and legal to (1) finalize audit-logging spec and ownership, (2) decide infra model, and (3) lock capacity and finance guardrails — assign owners and
