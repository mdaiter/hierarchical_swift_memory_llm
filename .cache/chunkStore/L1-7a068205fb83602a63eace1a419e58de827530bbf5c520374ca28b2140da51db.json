Decide infra model: infra uplift vs. shared tenancy — owner: finance + ops\/infra; output: chosen model, cost\/operational tradeoffs, migration\/implementation plan.\n2. Produce audit-logging specification — owner: infra\/security\/ops; outputs: what to log, retention, storage, access controls, audit trail format, who signs off (finance\/legal).\n3. Align legal and telemetry requirements — owner: legal + telemetry + Matthew; outputs: allowed data types, retention policies, consent\/compliance constraints.\n4. Finalize capacity planning and finance guardrails — owner: ops + finance; outputs: capacity numbers, threshold rules, escalation\/approval process.\n5. Confirm whether the repeated emails are intentional or erroneous and consolidate status updates — owner: ops@atlas.vc \/ Matthew.\n\nRecommended next actions\n- Draft and circulate a single audit-logging spec for review by infra\/security, finance, and legal.\n- Convene a short decision meeting (finance, ops\/infra, legal, telemetry) to resolve tenancy model and sign off guardrails.\n- Stop periodic duplicate updates; issue one consolidated status that lists outstanding decisions, owners, and deadlines.\n\nKeywords\/tags\nAgentic pilot; legal–telemetry alignment; capacity planning;
