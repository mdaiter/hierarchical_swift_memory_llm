Decide infra model: infra uplift vs shared tenancy.\n   - Owner: Atlas \/ ops\n   - Requested by: VectorPulse finance (Ben)\n2. Define audit-logging requirements (scope, format, retention, access, audit evidence).\n   - Owner: Atlas \/ ops (coordinate with legal\/telemetry)\n   - Requested by: VectorPulse finance\n3. Clarify legal ↔ telemetry alignment and implications for capacity planning and finance guardrails.\n   - Owner: Atlas legal + ops\n   - Requested by: both parties\n4. Confirm capacity planning numbers and finance guardrails based on chosen infra model and legal\/telemetry constraints.\n   - Owner: Atlas ops with finance collaboration\n5. Specify billing carve-outs (criteria, accounting treatment) and finalize automation runbooks (content, owners, testing\/rollout).\n   - Owner: ops-team \/ ops-analyst (CFO involved)\n6. Assign owners, due dates, and success criteria for items 1–5; respond to finance’s repeated questions.\n   - Owner: matthew@atlas.vc \/ ops \/ CFO (to propose timelines)\n\nStatus \/ next suggested step\n- High priority: provide definitive infra-model decision and audit-logging specification to unblock remaining items. Ops\/team should propose owners and deadlines for the unresolved items when responding to Ben.\n\nTags\n- infra-model, audit-logging, legal-telemetry, capacity-planning, finance-guardrails,
