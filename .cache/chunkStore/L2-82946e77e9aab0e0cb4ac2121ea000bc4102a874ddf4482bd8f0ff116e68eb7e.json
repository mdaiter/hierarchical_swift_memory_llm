Finance\/Legal signature on the deck — Owner: Finance \/ Legal; escalator\/follow-up: Matthew. Status: pending.\n2.

confirm current Finance\/Legal signature status and ETA; explicitly confirm seat ramp to Ben.\n- Legal + Product: align and confirm acceptance\/wording of telemetry clause to Ben and Finance.\n- Finance + Infra\/Eng: decide infra model (uplift vs shared tenancy) and communicate cost\/controls implications.\n- Security\/Infra\/Compliance: produce audit-logging spec aligned to chosen infra model.\n- Ops \/ RevOps \/ CFO: assign named owners, deadlines, and success criteria for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks; report status to stakeholders.\n\nTags \/
