stakeholders — due ASAP.\n- Matthew (or designated contract owner): respond to Ben with seat ramp schedule\/commitment or constraints — due ASAP.\n- Finance \/ Engineering \/ Legal: resolve infra uplift vs shared tenancy decision and state audit-logging implications — assign owner & ETA.\n- Ops\/CFO: assign owners and deadlines for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks; publish a one-line status update per item.\n- Communication: consolidate responses and send a single update to Ben to stop repeated pings.\n\nPriority signals\n- High — telemetry acknowledgment and
