Activity spans 2024-05-15 to 2024-05-17.\n- Core themes: legal ↔ telemetry alignment, capacity planning, finance guardrails; recurring finance questions about infra model (infra uplift vs. shared tenancy) and audit logging clarity.\n- Last recorded message: Ben update #500 at 2024-05-17 05:15 UTC.\n\nDecisions\n- None recorded in the thread.\n\nConcerns (explicit)\n- Finance requires clarity on infra uplift (dedicated infra) versus shared-tenancy (cost\/ownership\/allocation implications).\n- Audit logging requirements (scope, retention, access\/verification, implementation owner) are unclear.\n- Legal and telemetry alignment is incomplete — may change telemetry\/audit\/capacity requirements.\n- Capacity planning and finance guardrails are not finalized and may be affected by the infra\/legal\/telemetry choices.\n\nUnresolved items \/ Action items (current state + suggested owners)\n1. Decide infra model: infra uplift vs. shared tenancy.\n   - Suggested owners: Finance + Engineering; involve Ops for implementation impact.\n2. Define audit logging: what to log, retention, access controls, verification\/audit process.\n   - Suggested owners: Security\/Engineering + Legal; Finance to confirm cost\/guardrails.\n3. Confirm legal ↔ telemetry alignment and any resulting changes to telemetry design, data retention, or access.\n   - Suggested owners: Legal + Telemetry\/Engineering; inform Ops and Finance.\n4. Finalize capacity planning numbers and explicit finance guardrails (budgeting, allocation, chargeback).\n   - Suggested owners: Finance + Ops; engineering to validate technical feasibility.\n5. Assign owners and timelines for each unresolved item and communicate next steps to Ops (currently only CC’d, no active responses recorded).\n\nNotes \/ Signal\n- The thread is repetitive and urgent in tone; no substantive resolutions documented despite many
