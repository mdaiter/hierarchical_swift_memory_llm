Status: sent \/ awaiting signature.\n- Agentic pilot updates (#35–#37) distributed covering capacity planning and finance guardrails — information communicated to stakeholders.\n- Ops-analyst, CFO, and rev-ops are actively tracking audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks (ongoing monitoring).\n\nConcerns \/ Questions\n- Finance asked about infra uplift versus shared tenancy tradeoffs (costs vs controls).\n- Explicit request for clarity on audit logging ownership\/requirements (Ben asked in update #36).\n- VectorPulse contract items: seat ramp schedule and telemetry clause need acknowledgement from VectorPulse (Ben repeatedly requested confirmation).\n- Risk: unresolved audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks could create operational\/compliance gaps.\n\nUnresolved items \/ Action items (owners & status)\n1. Confirm Finance\/Legal signature on the deck. Owner: Finance\/Legal; escalator: Matthew. Status: pending.\n2. Receive VectorPulse confirmation on telemetry clause and seat ramp schedule. Owner: VectorPulse \/ Ben to confirm; Matthew to escalate. Status: unresolved (Ben repeatedly pinged).\n3. Decide infra approach: uplift vs shared tenancy — evaluate tradeoffs (cost, controls, implementation). Owner: Finance + Infra\/Eng (question raised by Finance). Status: unresolved.\n4. Clarify audit logging requirements and ownership (scope, retention, responsibility). Owner: Security\/Infra\/Compliance; requested by Ben. Status: open.\n5. Finalize and close gaps on audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks — assign owners and ETAs. Owner: ops-analyst \/ rev-ops \/ CFO; Status: tracked but not closed.\n6. Confirm if capacity planning or finance guardrails need changes after decisions above. Owner: Matthew \/ Finance \/ Ops; Status: pending follow-up.\n\nNotes\n- Multiple duplicate\/near-duplicate posts across Slack\/iMessage\/WhatsApp indicate retry\/notification noise and urgency around legal\/contract confirmation.\n- Primary blockers: legal\/finance sign-off and VectorPulse acknowledgement of contract terms; dependent items (audit logging, tenancy decision) need resolution to finalize capacity\/finance guardrails and operational
