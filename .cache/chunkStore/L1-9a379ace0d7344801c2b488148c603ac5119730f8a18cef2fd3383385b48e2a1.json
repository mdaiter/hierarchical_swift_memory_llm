Matthew repeatedly reported he was \"pushing the deck to finance and legal for signature\" but gave no substantive ack on those points. Ben also emailed an Agentic pilot update noting finance Q#114 about infra uplift vs. shared tenancy and audit-logging clarity; another update referenced legal\/telemetry alignment, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n\nDecisions \/ Actions taken (recorded)\n- Matthew pushed the deck to finance and legal for signature (escalated; status update).\n- Agentic pilot update(s) issued to surface legal\/telemetry alignment and finance questions.\n\nConcerns \/ Questions (raised)\n- Explicit confirmation\/acknowledgement of the seat ramp (ramp schedule\/seat counts).\n- Explicit acceptance\/acknowledgement of the telemetry clause (privacy\/telemetry terms).\n- Finance question #114: clarity on infra uplift vs. shared tenancy and audit-logging requirements.\n- Timeline for finance\/legal sign-off and when the deck will be formally signed.\n\nUnresolved items \/ Action items\n- No recorded confirmation that Atlas accepted the telemetry clause.\n- No recorded confirmation of the agreed seat ramp (numbers\/schedule).\n- No recorded confirmation that finance\/legal have signed the deck (and no signature date).\n- Outstanding answer to finance Q#114 (infra uplift vs shared tenancy; audit logging).\n- Need ETA from finance\/legal for final review\/signature.\n\nSignals \/ context\n- Multiple repeated short pings from both parties indicate urgency\/pressure and lack of substantive acknowledgement in-thread.\n\nRecommended immediate next steps (capture in memory)\n- Obtain and record: (1) explicit telemetry-clause ack (yes\/no and any edits), (2) agreed seat-ramp details, (3) confirmation of signed deck and signature date, (4) response to finance
