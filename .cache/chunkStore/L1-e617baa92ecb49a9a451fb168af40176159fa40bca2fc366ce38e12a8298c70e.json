Multiple repeated pings from Ben requesting confirmations indicate urgency.\n\nDecisions \/ confirmed actions\n- Matthew forwarded the deal deck to Finance and Legal for signature.\n- Ops\/CFO are actively tracking audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks.\n- Agentic pilot updates documented capacity planning and finance guardrails and flagged legal\/telemetry alignment.\n\nConcerns \/ open questions\n- Ben requests explicit confirmation of:\n  - the seat ramp (timing\/plan)\n  - acknowledgement of the telemetry clause\n- Finance\/Engineering\/legal need to clarify infra uplift vs shared tenancy and the audit-logging implications (called out in Agentic pilot update #46).\n- Legal + telemetry alignment is outstanding.\n\nUnresolved items \/ action items (owners & status)\n- Confirm Finance\/Legal signature on the deck — Owner: Finance\/Legal \/ Matthew — Pending.\n- Confirm seat ramp with Ben (explicit yes\/no and timing) — Owner: Matthew \/ Ben — Pending.\n- Acknowledge telemetry clause to Ben — Owner: Matthew \/ Legal — Pending.\n- Resolve infra uplift vs shared tenancy question and audit-logging implications — Owner: Finance \/ Engineering \/ Legal — Pending.\n- Continue and close tracking items: audit coverage, billing carve-outs, automation runbooks — Owner: Ops-analyst \/ Ops-team \/ CFO — In progress; no closure recorded.\n- Legal + telemetry alignment follow-up (per email) — Owner: Legal \/ Matthew \/ Ben — Pending.\n\nSuggested next steps (concise)\n- Matthew (or designated owner) reply to Ben confirming seat ramp and telemetry clause acknowledgement.\n- Finance\/Legal confirm signature status and notify stakeholders.\n- Finance\/Engineering\/Legal provide an explicit decision and audit-logging implications for infra uplift vs shared tenancy.\n- Ops\/CFO publish short status updates with owners\/timelines for audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks.\n\nStatus note\n- Multiple duplicate messages and repeated pings suggest stakeholder urgency and lack of prior explicit
