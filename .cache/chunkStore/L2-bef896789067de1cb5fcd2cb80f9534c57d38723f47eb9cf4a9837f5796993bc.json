Telemetry clause: no recorded explicit acknowledgement\/acceptance from Atlas Legal\/Finance.  \n2. Seat ramp: no recorded confirmation of schedule \/ seat counts.  \n3. Deck signature: status\/confirmation that Finance & Legal have signed (and signature date) unknown.  \n4. Infra model: unresolved finance question(s) re uplift vs shared tenancy (Q#112\/#114\/#116\/#118\/#120\/#122 variants).  \n5. Audit logging: scope, retention, owners, access and how it maps to telemetry\/legal obligations unspecified.  \n6. Contract language: any edits required arising from legal\/telemetry alignment, capacity or finance guardrails not documented.  \n7. ETA\/communication: Ben has not received a clear ETA or formal responses to the outstanding questions.\n\nImmediate next steps (owners & suggested timing)\n- Matthew \/ Atlas: follow up with Finance & Legal to (a) confirm signature\/status of the deck, (b) explicitly ACK or propose edits to the telemetry clause, (c) confirm the agreed seat-ramp details, and (d) request answers to the infra vs shared-tenancy and audit-logging questions. Suggested: initial follow-up within 24 hours; escalate if no substantive response within 48 hours.\n- Atlas Finance & Legal: provide written responses on telemetry acceptance, sign or return the deck with redlines, and answer finance question(s) re infra model and audit-logging requirements. Suggested: respond within 24–48 hours.\n- Product \/ Infra \/ Engineering: produce a short recommendation on infra uplift vs shared-tenancy (cost\/ops\/security tradeoffs) and specify audit-logging implementation details (what is logged, retention, who can access). Suggested: deliver within 24–48 hours to inform Legal\/Finance sign-off.\n- Security \/ Compliance: validate audit-logging spec and confirm mapping to telemetry clause obligations.\n\nKey ask to
