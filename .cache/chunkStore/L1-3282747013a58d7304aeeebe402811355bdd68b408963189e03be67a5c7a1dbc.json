Participants: Matthew (matthew@atlas.vc), Ben (ben@vectorpulse.ai), ops-analyst, CFO, ops-team. Multiple duplicate messages across iMessage, WhatsApp, Slack and one follow-up email (Agentic pilot update #65).\n\nDecisions \/ confirmed actions\n- Matthew has repeatedly pushed the contract\/deck to Finance and Legal for signature (primary owner: Matthew).\n- Ops\/CFO\/Rev-ops are actively tracking three operational items: audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and automation runbooks.\n- Agentic pilot update #65 email sent covering legal + telemetry alignment, capacity planning, and finance guardrails.\n\nConcerns \/ active topics\n- Telemetry clause: counterparty needs explicit acknowledgement.\n- Seat ramp: confirmation of seat counts and timing required.\n- Audit coverage scope and audit logging requirements need clarification.\n- Billing carve-outs and automation runbooks (operational\/compliance readiness).\n- Finance question #66: infra uplift vs. shared tenancy — decision pending.\n- Risk of signature delay pending finance\/legal review.\n\nUnresolved items \/ follow-ups (with owners)\n1. Deck signature status — owner: Matthew. Action: confirm whether Finance & Legal have signed; provide ETA\/status.\n2. Telemetry clause acknowledgement — owner: Ben \/ Matthew. Action: Ben needs explicit acknowledgement from Atlas (or legal) that clause is acceptable.\n3. Seat ramp numbers and timeline — owner: Ben \/ Matthew. Action: confirm and publish ramp schedule.\n4. Audit logging \/ audit coverage scope — owner: Ops-analyst \/ CFO. Action: define scope and confirm contractual implications.\n5. Billing carve-outs and automation runbooks — owner: Ops-analyst \/ CFO. Action: finalize carve-outs and runbook ownership\/automation plan.\n6. Finance question #66 (infra uplift vs shared tenancy) — owner: Finance\/Legal. Action: provide decision and any contract language adjustments.\n\nStatus & signals\n- High urgency from Ben (multiple WhatsApp pings requesting seat ramp and telemetry ack).\n- Repeated sends from Matthew indicate push to get signature but no confirmed sign-off recorded.\n- Ops\/CFO messaging shows active tracking but items remain open.\n\nRecommended immediate next steps\n- Matthew: confirm deck signature status and share ETA publicly in Slack\/email.\n- Legal\/Finance: respond to telemetry clause and finance Q#66 explicitly (copy Ben).\n- Ops\/CFO: consolidate audit coverage, billing carve-outs, and runbook items into an assigned checklist with owners and deadlines; share with Matthew and Ben.\n\nUnresolved items should be closed in the order above to remove contract blockers (telemetry + seat ramp +
